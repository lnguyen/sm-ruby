# SM Rails Extension

The Rails extension is used to manage all aspects of a Ruby/Rails
application project deployment as a user.

For example, if the project name is 'todo' then for deployment
you would typically create an 'todo' user on the server with
home directory of /home/todo.

An detailed walkthrough of using SM Rails extension in conjunction
with other extensions (below) to manage an application deployment may be
found on the RVM website at
